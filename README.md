# BERT-Model-for-Depression-Severity-Prediction
Code and experiments for a BERT regression model that estimates depression severity from social-media text

Features:

🧠 Regression on continuous severity scores (e.g., 0–1).

🧹 Lightweight preprocessing tuned for noisy social-media text.

⚖️ Imbalance handling: weighted loss and simple oversampling.

📏 Metrics: MSE, MAE, R², accuracy/F1 via thresholded class mapping.

🔁 Reproducibility: fixed seeds, deterministic flags, and run logs.

🔍 Explainability: attention visualisation or SHAP overlays.
